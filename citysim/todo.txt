(Hopefully) future additional extensions/features:
- custom and accurate train counts, speeds (from https://new.mta.info/schedules, The Weekender)
- tweaks to pathfinding algorithm for better realism
	- dynamically update weights for algorithm using train ETAs (incorporate headways)
		- use D*?
	- adjust algorithm hyperparameters (and add variance to individual agent heuristics) for realistic choice-making
- drawing "complex lines" instead of straight lines between stations (I already have the data)
	- making trains follow those lines
	- giving trains basic physics (accel, decel, turning)
		- or at least precompute this for realistic headways
- randomized delays and train backups/queues
- schedule switching (weekend/late-night/etc.)
- enable citizens to travel between "custom" nodes to simulate walking into the system from non-station endpoints
- import bus routes (big)
