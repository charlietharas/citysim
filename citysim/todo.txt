Optional additional extensions/features:
- cleaner logging and proper debug/test modes
- get more realistic train speeds and headways from The Weekender
- drawing "complex lines" instead of straight lines between stations (I already have the data)
	- making trains follow those lines
	- giving trains basic physics (accel, decel, turning)
		- or at least precompute this for realistic headways
- randomized delays and train backups/queues
- schedule switching (weekend/late-night/etc.)
- enable citizens to travel between "custom" nodes to simulate walking into the system from non-station endpoints
- implement shrink function for citizen vector
- import bus routes (big)
